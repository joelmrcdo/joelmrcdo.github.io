# Trading Blog

This project hosts a simple trading blog built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and served through GitHub Pages. It aims to share trading ideas and Python examples through notebooks and posts.

## Project Goals

- Document and experiment with trading strategies.
- Publish the blog with GitHub Pages.

## Theme

The site currently uses the `jekyll-theme-minimal` theme configured in
`_config.yml`. To try a different look, change the `theme:` value in that file
and update the `Gemfile` if required. After editing either file, run:

```bash
bundle install
```

to install any new dependencies.

## Getting Started

1. Install Ruby and Bundler. On Ubuntu you can run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential
   gem install bundler
   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

   Run `bundle install` again whenever you modify `_config.yml` or the
   `Gemfile` to make sure any new gems are installed. These commands
   should be executed without `sudo` so Bundler can manage gems in your
   user environment.

3. Serve the site locally:


   ```bash
   bundle exec jekyll serve
   ```

   Run the serve command as a normal user as well—no root privileges are
   required.

   Then open `http://127.0.0.1:4000/` in your browser.

4. Explore the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory with Jupyter.

### Changing the Theme

To use a theme gem such as [`minima`](https://github.com/jekyll/minima),
add it to your `Gemfile` and update `_config.yml`:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "minima"
```

```yaml
# _config.yml
theme: minima
```

After modifying the `Gemfile`, run `bundle update` so `Gemfile.lock`
includes the theme version.

## Deployment

Build the static site with:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll build
```

The generated HTML will be available in the `_site/` directory and can be deployed to GitHub Pages.


## Interactive Notebooks

This site now loads a lightweight Python environment in the browser using Thebe and JupyterLite. Posts and notebook pages include a **Run** button. Click it to execute the code directly in your browser—no local Python installation is required. When network access is unavailable, the examples fall back to built‑in sample data so charts can still be generated. Once connectivity is restored, the same cells will automatically pull real prices via `yfinance`.
